# AI Ethics - Prompt Piscine

## Overview

This project is about learning to use AI ethically and becoming an irreplaceable developer. The goal is not just to get answers from AI, but to use AI as a learning amplifier while developing judgment, systems thinking, and deep understanding.

**Key principle:** If your only skill is writing code that AI can write, you are already replaceable. This project trains you to think and learn independently.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand basic principles of AI ethics and responsible use
- Identify common types of bias in datasets and model outputs
- Design prompts that are transparent, safe, and free from harmful assumptions
- Learn to handle sensitive or incorrect model outputs responsibly
- Understand the difference between using AI to learn vs. using AI to avoid learning
- Develop skills that make you irreplaceable as a coder

## Exercises

- **Exercise 00**: Learning to Use AI Ethically as a Coder
- **Exercise 0**: Environment and Libraries (AI learning ethics commitment)
- **Exercise 1**: Understanding AI Bias
- **Exercise 2**: Designing Ethical Prompts
- **Exercise 3**: Detecting and Mitigating Harmful Outputs
- **Exercise 4**: AI as Learning Amplifier (wireless routing protocols case study)

## Important Note

All submitted answers must be written in your own words. Responses identified as being generated by AI tools will be rejected. This project requires independent thinking and genuine understanding.
