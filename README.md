# AI Ethics Project

## Student
Teo Vairaktaris - Zone01 Athens

## Overview
This project is about learning to use AI ethically and responsibly. The goal is to use AI as a learning tool, not as a replacement for thinking.

**Key lesson:** If my only skill is writing code that AI can write, I am already replaceable.

## What I Learned

- How bias enters AI systems
- How to design ethical prompts
- How to detect harmful AI outputs
- How to use AI to amplify learning instead of replacing it
- Critical thinking and judgment skills that make me irreplaceable

## Project Structure

## Key Takeaways

1. **Struggle first, then use AI** - The struggle is where learning happens
2. **AI as partner, not replacement** - Come to AI with questions, not for answers
3. **Build irreplaceable skills** - Judgment, critical thinking, systems design
4. **Take responsibility** - I'm responsible for all outputs, even if AI generated them

## Exercises Completed

- ✅ Exercise 00: Learning to Use AI Ethically
- ✅ Exercise 0: Environment and Libraries
- ✅ Exercise 1: Understanding AI Bias (gender bias in professions)
- ✅ Exercise 2: Designing Ethical Prompts (neutral language, explicit diversity)
- ✅ Exercise 3: Detecting Harmful Outputs (medical misinformation)
- ✅ Exercise 4: AI as Learning Amplifier (wireless routing protocols)

## Important Note

All answers are written in my own words in simple English. This demonstrates actual understanding, not just copying AI outputs.
