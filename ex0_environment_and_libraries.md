## Part 3: Personal AI Learning Ethics Commitment

### My Commitment to Using AI as a Learning Amplifier

**I will use AI to:**
- Understand concepts better after I struggle with them myself first.
- Check if my solutions are correct and learn about alternative approaches.
- Explore edge cases I might have missed.
- Get feedback on my explanations to see if I really understand.
- Ask questions about things I don't know but want to learn deeply.
- Work smarter after I already understand the fundamentals.

**I will NOT use AI to:**
- Get answers before I give it a try myself.
- Skip learning the fundamentals that I should know by heart.
- Replace my own thinking.
- Avoid reading documentation.
- Generate and copy pasting code I don't understand
- Submit work I cant explain.
- Use during exams or tests.
