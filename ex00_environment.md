## Part 3: Personal AI Learning Ethics Commitment

### My Commitment to Using AI as a Learning Amplifier

**I will use AI to:**

<!-- TODO: Write your commitments. Be specific and honest. Example:
- Amplify my understanding after I've struggled with a concept myself
- Test my knowledge by asking AI to quiz me
- Explore edge cases and alternative approaches I haven't considered
- Get feedback on my work and explanations
- Challenge my assumptions and identify blind spots
- Work faster AFTER I understand deeply, not to avoid understanding
- Learn how to ask better questions and think more critically
-->

**I will NOT use AI to:**

<!-- TODO: Write your boundaries. Example:
- Get answers before attempting problems myself
- Skip the struggle of learning fundamentals
- Replace my own thinking and judgment
- Avoid reading documentation and official sources
- Generate code I don't understand
- Submit work I can't explain without AI's help
- Use as a crutch during exams or assessments
- Bypass building the skills that make me irreplaceable
-->

**I know I'm using AI fairly when:**

<!-- TODO: Write your success criteria. Example:
- I can explain everything in my own words without AI
- I could solve similar problems independently
- I feel more confident and knowledgeable after using AI
- I'm asking "why" and "how" questions, not just "what"
- I come to AI WITH ideas and questions, not FOR ideas
- My understanding is deeper than if I'd worked alone
- I can defend my decisions and choices
- I've added value through my judgment, not just copied AI
-->

**How I'll know if I'm using AI wrong:**

<!-- TODO: Warning signs to watch for. Example:
- I can't explain the code/concepts without looking at AI responses
- I feel dependent on AI to complete basic tasks
- I'm anxious about working without AI available
- I copy-paste without understanding
- I skip reading documentation because "AI is faster"
- I can't tell if AI's answer is right or wrong
- My learning feels shallow and nothing sticks
- I'm replaceable by anyone with access to the same AI
-->

## Part 5: Accountability and Review

### Weekly Check-in Questions

**Ask yourself these questions at the end of each week:**

1. **Did I attempt problems myself before asking AI?**
   - Yes / No / Sometimes
   - If no, why not? What will I change?

2. **Can I explain what I learned without looking at AI responses?**
   - Yes / No / Partially
   - Test this by trying to teach the concept to someone else

3. **Did I feel more capable this week, or more dependent?**
   - More capable / More dependent / Same
   - What caused this feeling?

4. **What's one thing I learned that I'll still remember in 6 months?**
   - Why will I remember it?

5. **Did AI make me sharper or lazier this week?**
   - Sharper / Lazier
   - What evidence supports this?

### Final Self-Assessment (Complete at the end of the project)

**Before this project, my relationship with AI was:**
<!-- TODO: Reflect on where you started -->

**After this project, my relationship with AI is:**
<!-- TODO: Reflect on how you've changed -->

**The most important lesson I learned:**
<!-- TODO: One key takeaway -->

**How I'll use AI differently going forward:**
<!-- TODO: Concrete changes in your approach -->

**Skills I built that AI can't replace:**
<!-- TODO: What makes you irreplaceable now? -->

---

## Commitment Signature

I commit to using AI as a learning amplifier, not as a replacement for thinking. I understand that if my only skill is writing code that AI can write, I am already replaceable. My goal is to become irreplaceable by developing judgment, systems thinking, and deep understanding.

## Notes and Observations

**Space for ongoing notes throughout the project:**

<!-- TODO: Use this space to jot down thoughts, challenges, insights as you work through the exercises.

Example entries:
- Week 1: Struggled with understanding OSPF but the struggle helped it stick
- Caught myself trying to ask AI before attempting - stopped and tried myself first
- Realized I was copying code without understanding - went back and studied it properly
- Had a breakthrough understanding how bias enters AI systems
